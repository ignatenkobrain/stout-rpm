%description devel
Headers used for for development of sturdy applications, and leveraged
by Mesos.

Stout is a header only library that is contains a series of primitives 
to assist in the development of building sturdy C++ applications.  Currently
this application is leveraged by Mesos.

Note: as that project has only headers (i.e., no library/binary object),
this package (i.e., the -devel package) is the one containing all of the 
project.  There's no package with a library to link for this.
